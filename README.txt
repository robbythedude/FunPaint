This is FunPaint! Programmed in Java by Robert Steiner using the IDE NetBeans.
Everything seems pretty self explanatory, so get at it!!

Download the root folder FunPaint, and NetBeans will launch it as a Project.
In the FunPaint/SRC/ folder, you'll find all my custom classes.

Bugs
----
-Certain save feature will cause a black background overwrite.
-Print feature might trip up sometimes
